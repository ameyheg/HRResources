                                        9-box to identify succession candidates for critical roles<br />• Differentiate
                                        investment: accelerate for Stars, develop for Growth, manage out Risks<br />•

                                    <p>• Don't track everything — track what drives decisions<br />• Start with 6–8 core
                                        metrics, not 30<br />• Ask: "If this metric changes, would leadership take
